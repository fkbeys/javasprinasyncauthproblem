Although I applied all the solutions on the internet, I still could not solve the problem.

Synchronous method in my controller works normally.
But the asynchronous method gives an authentication error every time.
However, both methods do the same job and get the same Token.
The codes of my project are available below.
I think the bug is still not resolved.
